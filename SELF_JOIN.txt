#SQL Self JOIN
->A self JOIN is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.


#Self JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;

NOTE: T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table.

#SQL Self JOIN Example
The following SQL statement matches customers that are from the same city:

SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;



#SELF JOIN: 
->As the name signifies, in SELF JOIN a table is joined to itself. That is, each row of the table is 
joined with itself and all other rows depending on some conditions. 
->In other words we can say that it is a join between two copies of the same table.

Syntax:
SELECT a.coulmn1 , b.column2
FROM table_name a, table_name b
WHERE some_condition;

table_name: Name of the table.
some_condition: Condition for selecting the rows.

Example Queries(SELF JOIN):

SELECT a.ROLL_NO , b.NAME
FROM Student a, Student b
WHERE a.ROLL_NO < b.ROLL_NO;
