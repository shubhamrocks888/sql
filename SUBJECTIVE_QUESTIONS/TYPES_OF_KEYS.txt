#Different Types of Keys in Relational Model

1.Candidate Key: 
->The minimal set of attribute which can uniquely identify a tuple is known as candidate key. 

For Example, STUD_NO in STUDENT relation.

->The value of Candidate Key is unique and non-null for every tuple.

->There can be more than one candidate key in a relation. 
  For Example, STUD_NO is candidate key for relation STUDENT.

->The candidate key can be simple (having only one attribute) or composite as well. 
  For Example, {STUD_NO, COURSE_NO} is a composite candidate key for relation STUDENT_COURSE.


2.Super Key: 
->The set of attributes which can uniquely identify a tuple is known as Super Key. 
  For Example, STUD_NO, (STUD_NO, STUD_NAME) etc.

->Adding zero or more attributes to candidate key generates super key.
->A candidate key is a super key but vice versa is not true.

3.Primary Key: 
->There can be more than one candidate key in relation out of which one can be chosen as the primary key. 
  For Example, STUD_NO, as well as STUD_PHONE both, are candidate keys for relation STUDENT but STUD_NO 
  can be chosen as the primary key (only one out of many candidate keys).

4.Alternate Key: 
->The candidate key other than the primary key is called an alternate key. 
  For Example, STUD_NO, as well as STUD_PHONE both, are candidate keys for relation STUDENT but STUD_PHONE 
  will be alternate key (only one out of many candidate keys).
