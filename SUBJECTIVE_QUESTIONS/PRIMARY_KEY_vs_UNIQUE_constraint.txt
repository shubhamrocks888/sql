Que: What is the difference between primary key and unique constraints?

Sol:

Primary key cannot have NULL value, the unique constraints can have NULL values. 
There is only one primary key in a table, but there can be multiple unique constrains. 
The primary key creates the cluster index automatically but the Unique key does not.
