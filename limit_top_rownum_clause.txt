#SQL TOP, LIMIT or ROWNUM Clause:

->The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

->The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. 
->Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

#Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports 
       the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses ROWNUM.


#SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:
SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


#MySQL Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;


#Oracle Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE ROWNUM <= number;
