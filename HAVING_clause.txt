#SQL HAVING Clause

->The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.

HAVING Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);


#SQL HAVING Examples
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country. 
Only include countries with more than 5 customers:

Example
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
