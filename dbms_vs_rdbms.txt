It is used for small organization and deal with small data.	It is used to handle large amount of data.

It supports single user.					It supports multiple users.

Data fetching is slower for the large amount of data.		Data fetching is fast because of relational approach.

The data in a DBMS is subject to low security levels with 	There exists multiple levels of data security in a RDBMS.
regards to data manipulation.	

Low software and hardware necessities.				Higher software and hardware necessities.

Examples: XML, Microsoft Access, etc.				Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.
