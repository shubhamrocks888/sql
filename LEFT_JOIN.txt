		#SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword

The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matched records 
from the right table (table2). The result is NULL from the right side, if there is no match.


#LEFT JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

Note: In some databases LEFT JOIN is called LEFT OUTER JOIN.


#LEFT JOIN: 
->This join returns all the rows of the table on the left side of the join and matching rows 
for the table on the right side of join. 
->The rows for which there is no matching row on right side, the result-set will contain null. 

->LEFT JOIN is also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN.

Syntax:
SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
FROM table1 
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;


table1: First table.
table2: Second table
matching_column: Column common to both the tables.
Note: We can also use LEFT OUTER JOIN instead of LEFT JOIN, both are same.


#SQL LEFT JOIN Example:
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;

Note: The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (Customers), 
      even if there are no matches in the right table (Orders).
