#SQL ANY and ALL Operators

->The ANY and ALL operators are used with a WHERE or HAVING clause.

->The ANY operator returns true if any of the subquery values meet the condition.

->The ALL operator returns true if all of the subquery values meet the condition.


#ANY Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ANY
(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);


#ALL Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ALL
(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);


Note: The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=).


#SQL ANY Examples
The ANY operator returns TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the condition.

The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the product names if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table that quantity = 10:

Example
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);


SQL ALL Example
The ALL operator returns TRUE if all of the subquery values meet the condition.

The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the product names if ALL the records in the OrderDetails table has quantity = 10 (so, this example will return FALSE, because not ALL records in the OrderDetails table has quantity = 10):

Example
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ALL (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);
