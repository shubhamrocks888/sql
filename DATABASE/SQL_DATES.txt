#SQL Working With Dates

->The most difficult part when working with dates is to be sure that the format of the date 
  you are trying to insert, matches the format of the date column in the database.

->As long as your data contains only the date portion, your queries will work as expected. 
  However, if a time portion is involved, it gets more complicated.


#SQL Date Data Types
->MySQL comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:

DATE 	   - format  YYYY-MM-DD
DATETIME   - format  YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
TIMESTAMP  - format  YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
YEAR 	   - format  YYYY or YY

#Note: 
The date types are chosen for a column when you create a new table in your database!


#You can compare two dates easily if there is no time component involved!

Assume we have the following "Orders" table:

OrderId	ProductName		OrderDate
1	Geitost			2008-11-11
2	Camembert Pierrot	2008-11-09


Now we want to select the records with an OrderDate of "2008-11-11" from the table above.
We use the following SELECT statement:

SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate='2008-11-11'



#Now, assume that the "Orders" table looks like this (notice the time component in the "OrderDate" column):

OrderId	ProductName		OrderDate
1	Geitost			2008-11-11 13:23:44
2	Camembert Pierrot	2008-11-09 15:45:21

If we use the same SELECT statement as above:

SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate='2008-11-11'
we will get no result! This is because the query is looking only for dates with no time portion.

Tip: To keep your queries simple and easy to maintain, do not allow time components in your dates!
