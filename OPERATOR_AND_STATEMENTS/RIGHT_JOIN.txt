RIGHT JOIN table2

#RIGHT JOIN: 
RIGHT JOIN is similar to LEFT JOIN. This join returns all the rows of the table on the right side of the join 
and matching rows for the table on the left side of join. 
The rows for which there is no matching row on left side, the result-set will contain null. 
RIGHT JOIN is also known as RIGHT OUTER JOIN.


#Syntax:
SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
FROM table1 
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;


table1: First table.
table2: Second table
matching_column: Column common to both the tables.

Note: We can also use RIGHT OUTER JOIN instead of RIGHT JOIN, both are same.
