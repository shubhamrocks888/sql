SQL NULL Values:

->A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

->If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record 
without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.

Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. 
A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!


How to Test for NULL Values?

->It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.
->We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

#IS NULL Syntax
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;


#IS NOT NULL Syntax
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

Tip: Always use IS NULL to look for NULL values.
