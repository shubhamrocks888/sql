#SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword

->The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

Note: FULL OUTER JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets!

Tip: FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same.

#FULL OUTER JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;


#SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Example:
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;


Note: 
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all matching records from both tables whether the other table matches or not. 
So, if there are rows in "Customers" that do not have matches in "Orders", 
or if there are rows in "Orders" that do not have matches in "Customers",
those rows will be listed as well.


#FULL JOIN: 
FULL JOIN creates the result-set by combining result of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN. 
The result-set will contain all the rows from both the tables. 
The rows for which there is no matching, the result-set will contain NULL values.


Syntax:
SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
FROM table1 
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;


table1: First table.
table2: Second table
matching_column: Column common to both the tables.
