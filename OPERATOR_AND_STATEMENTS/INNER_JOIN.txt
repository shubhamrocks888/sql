		#SQL INNER JOIN Keyword

->The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.


The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both the tables as long as the condition satisfies. 
This keyword will create the result-set by combining all rows from both the tables where the 
condition satisfies i.e value of the common field will be same.

#Syntax:
SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
FROM table1 
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;


table1: First table.
table2: Second table
matching_column: Column common to both the tables.

Note: We can also write JOIN instead of INNER JOIN. JOIN is same as INNER JOIN.


Example:
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;

Note: The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. 
If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!


		#JOIN Three Tables

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);
