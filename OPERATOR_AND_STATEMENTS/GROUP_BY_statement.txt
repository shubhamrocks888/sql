#SQL GROUP BY Statement

->The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, 
  like "find the number of customers in each country".

->The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) 
  to group the result-set by one or more columns.

#Important Points:

GROUP BY clause is used with the SELECT statement.
->In the query, GROUP BY clause is placed after the WHERE clause.
->In the query, GROUP BY clause is placed before ORDER BY clause if used any.


#GROUP BY Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);


#SQL GROUP BY Examples:
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country:

Example
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;


The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low:

Example
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;


#GROUP BY With JOIN Example
The following SQL statement lists the number of orders sent by each shipper:

Example
SELECT Shippers.ShipperName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
GROUP BY ShipperName;


#Group By multiple columns: 
Group by multiple column is say for example, GROUP BY column1, column2. 
This means to place all the rows with same values of both the columns column1 and column2 in one group. 

Consider the below query:
SELECT SUBJECT, YEAR, Count(*)
FROM Student
GROUP BY SUBJECT, YEAR;
