#SQL UNION Operator

The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

->Each SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns.
->The columns must also have similar data types.
->The columns in each SELECT statement must also be in the same order.
->The fields to be used in both the select statements must be in same order, 
  same number and same data type.

#UNION Syntax
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

#NOTE:	UNION operator selects only distinct values by default.


#UNION ALL Syntax
To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL:

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

Note: The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement in the UNION.
